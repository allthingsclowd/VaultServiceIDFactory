# Vault Service ID Factory

## A Service (Secret-ID Factory) that generates a wrapped secret-id upon receipt of an app-role - (api only)

This will be used as the broker between vault and applications to bootstrap the password delivery process.

## TODO

### New Features
__Secret-ID Factory__
1. Build a new service (Secret-ID Factory) that generates a wrapped secret-id upon receipt of an app-role - (api only)
2. Build this in a separate repository using a similar CI/CD pipeline mentality
3. Deploy the new Secret-ID Factory as a service within this repo once complete
4. Configure a Consul Connect intention to permit the applications to communicate with the new Secret-ID Factory

### Refactor


## Done
